Trained model using tensor flow, keras api
Training model is at this colab - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rgT2fXECjbNPIy6v_NqED8myu8BCodmc#scrollTo=0LYZXCLmjMgS
moved the trained files like house_model.pkl, app.py, requirements.txt
moved them to github under chett34306/AI repo
connected with streamlit for UI and gave access to github at https://houzeprediction.streamlit.app/
Need to review the errors and fix it.
